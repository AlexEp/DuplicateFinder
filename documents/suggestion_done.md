## 3. Code Organization & Duplication

**Observation:**
There are several instances of duplicated code and misplaced logic.

**Suggestions:**

*   **Remove Duplicate Methods in `ui.py`:** The file `ui.py` contains multiple, identical definitions for `_preview_file` and `_get_relative_path_from_selection`. This was likely a copy-paste error and should be reduced to a single implementation for each.

*   **Consolidate UI Creation:** The UI frames for "Compare Folders", "Find Duplicates", and "Folder Search" are nearly identical. This can be refactored into a single factory method or class that creates a "folder selection frame" and returns it, avoiding the repetition of widget creation code.

*   **Move Helper Functions:** The `_find_connected_components` function inside `find_duplicates_strategy.py` is a generic graph traversal algorithm. It should be moved to a general utility module (e.g., a new `utils/graph_utils.py`) to be more reusable and to keep the strategy file focused on its primary task.

## 4. Configuration Management

**Observation:**
Configuration is scattered across `settings.json`, `llm_settings.json`, and hardcoded paths in `ai_engine/engine.py`. This makes configuration difficult to manage.

**Suggestions:**

*   **Create a Centralized `Config` Class:** Implement a singleton `Config` class that loads all settings from all configuration files (`settings.json`, `llm_settings.json`, etc.) upon application startup.
    *   This class would provide a single, consistent interface for the rest of the application to access configuration values (e.g., `Config.get('log_level')`, `Config.get('llm.similarity_threshold')`).
    *   This removes the need for multiple `try...except` blocks for file loading throughout the code.

*   **Move Hardcoded Paths to Configuration:** The model paths `LLAVA_MODEL_PATH` and `MMPROJ_MODEL_PATH` in `ai_engine/engine.py` should be removed and placed into `settings.json` or a new `models.json` config file. This allows users to change model locations without editing the source code.

*   **Externalize More Settings:** The file extension lists (`VIDEO_EXTENSIONS`, `AUDIO_EXTENSIONS`, `DOCUMENT_EXTENSIONS`) in `strategies/utils.py` should be moved into `settings.json` to make them user-configurable.

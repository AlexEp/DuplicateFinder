## 7. Performance Optimization

**Observation:**
The application recalculates metadata even when it might already be available, and the startup can be slow due to eager initialization of the LLM engine.

**Suggestions:**

*   **Avoid Recalculating Existing Metadata:** In `strategies/utils.py`, the `flatten_structure` function should be optimized to avoid re-computing expensive metadata. Before calculating an MD5 hash, histogram, or LLM embedding, the function should first check if that value already exists in the `FileNode`'s `metadata` dictionary. This will significantly speed up subsequent "Compare" actions when options are changed. (Note: Migrating to SQLite as suggested above would be a more robust way to solve this).

*   **Lazy Load the LLM Engine:** As mentioned previously, initializing the LLM engine on startup can make the application feel slow. This process should be deferred until the user first selects the "LLM Content" option, and it should be run in a background thread to avoid freezing the UI. A loading indicator should be shown to the user during this process.

## 3. Code Organization & Duplication

**Observation:**
There are several instances of duplicated code and misplaced logic.

**Suggestions:**

*   **Remove Duplicate Methods in `ui.py`:** The file `ui.py` contains multiple, identical definitions for `_preview_file` and `_get_relative_path_from_selection`. This was likely a copy-paste error and should be reduced to a single implementation for each.

*   **Consolidate UI Creation:** The UI frames for "Compare Folders", "Find Duplicates", and "Folder Search" are nearly identical. This can be refactored into a single factory method or class that creates a "folder selection frame" and returns it, avoiding the repetition of widget creation code.

*   **Move Helper Functions:** The `_find_connected_components` function inside `find_duplicates_strategy.py` is a generic graph traversal algorithm. It should be moved to a general utility module (e.g., a new `utils/graph_utils.py`) to be more reusable and to keep the strategy file focused on its primary task.

## 4. Configuration Management

**Observation:**
Configuration is scattered across `settings.json`, `llm_settings.json`, and hardcoded paths in `ai_engine/engine.py`. This makes configuration difficult to manage.

**Suggestions:**

*   **Create a Centralized `Config` Class:** Implement a singleton `Config` class that loads all settings from all configuration files (`settings.json`, `llm_settings.json`, etc.) upon application startup.
    *   This class would provide a single, consistent interface for the rest of the application to access configuration values (e.g., `Config.get('log_level')`, `Config.get('llm.similarity_threshold')`).
    *   This removes the need for multiple `try...except` blocks for file loading throughout the code.

*   **Move Hardcoded Paths to Configuration:** The model paths `LLAVA_MODEL_PATH` and `MMPROJ_MODEL_PATH` in `ai_engine/engine.py` should be removed and placed into `settings.json` or a new `models.json` config file. This allows users to change model locations without editing the source code.

*   **Externalize More Settings:** The file extension lists (`VIDEO_EXTENSIONS`, `AUDIO_EXTENSIONS`, `DOCUMENT_EXTENSIONS`) in `strategies/utils.py` should be moved into `settings.json` to make them user-configurable.

**Implement Fuzzy Matching for Filenames:**
*   Incorporate a fuzzy matching algorithm (e.g., Levenshtein distance) as a new duplicate finding strategy. This will allow the app to identify files with similar but not identical names, which is useful for finding typos or slight variations in filenames.

**Introduce a "Similar Pictures" Mode:**
*   Add a feature to find visually similar pictures, not just identical ones. This can be implemented using a perceptual hashing algorithm (like pHash). This would be a powerful new strategy for users dealing with large photo collections.

suggestion 2025-09-12 #3
**Add a "Music Mode" for Audio Files:**
*   For audio files, introduce a duplicate finding strategy that compares metadata tags (e.g., artist, album, title, track number) instead of just file content. This will help users identify duplicate songs that might be encoded differently.

suggestion 2025-09-12 #4
**Enhance Safety with a "Reference Directory" System:**
*   Allow users to designate one or more directories as "reference" or "master" directories. When displaying duplicate results, the application should prioritize suggesting deletions from non-reference directories, reducing the risk of accidental data loss.

suggestion 2025-09-12 #5
**Expand Actions for Duplicate Files:**
*   Beyond just deleting duplicates, provide users with more options, such as:
    *   Moving duplicates to a designated "archive" folder.
    *   Replacing duplicates with symbolic or hard links to a single master file.

suggestion 2025-09-12 #6
**Optimize Hashing with Parallel Processing:**
*   To improve performance when scanning large numbers of files, use a process pool to parallelize the calculation of file hashes. This is particularly effective for CPU-bound hashing operations.

suggestion 2025-09-12 #7
**Formalize a Plugin/Strategy Architecture:**
*   Refactor the duplicate finding logic to use a more formal plugin or strategy pattern. This will make it easier to add new finding methods (like fuzzy matching, image similarity, etc.) in the future without modifying the core application logic. Each strategy should be a self-contained module.

suggestion 2025-09-12 #8
**Decouple Core Logic from the User Interface:**
*   Following the example of `dupeguru`, ensure a clean separation between the application's core logic (file scanning, hashing, comparison) and the UI. This will make the codebase easier to maintain, test, and potentially adapt for different frontends (e.g., a command-line interface).

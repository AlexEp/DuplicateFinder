# Code Review Suggestions

This document provides a deep-dive analysis of the codebase and offers suggestions for improvement across several areas, including architecture, code organization, performance, and user experience.


## 3. Data Storage: Migrating from JSON to SQLite

**Observation:**
The current project file format (`.cfp`) is a single, large JSON file. This approach suffers from poor performance and scalability, as the entire file must be loaded into memory for any operation. A crash during a save can also corrupt the entire project.

**Best Practice Recommendation: Use SQLite**

**Advantages:**

*   **Performance & Scalability:** SQLite is designed for efficient, indexed queries. Finding duplicates or comparing files can be done with SQL queries that are orders of magnitude faster and more memory-efficient than iterating through a large Python object.
*   **Data Integrity:** SQLite provides atomic, transactional updates, protecting the project file from corruption if the application crashes.
*   **Efficient Queries:** Logic can be simplified. For example: `SELECT * FROM files GROUP BY size, md5 HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;`
*   **No New Dependencies:** The `sqlite3` module is part of the Python standard library.

**Implementation Steps:**

1.  **Define a Schema:** Create a simple schema on project creation (e.g., in `project_manager.py`).
    *   `project_settings` table: A key-value table for folder paths, UI options, etc.
    *   `files` table: Columns for `id`, `folder_index`, `relative_path`, `size`, `modified_date`, `md5`, `histogram`, `llm_embedding`.
2.  **Refactor Logic:**
    *   `build_folder_structure` would `INSERT` file records.
    *   `flatten_structure` would `UPDATE` rows with new metadata.
    *   Comparison strategies would be replaced with efficient SQL queries.

## 4. Metadata Calculation Architecture

**Observation:**
The `flatten_structure` function in `strategies/utils.py` is a monolithic function that mixes concerns: traversing the file tree, filtering files, and calculating various types of metadata (size, date, MD5, histogram, LLM). The logic for checking for cached metadata is also repeated for each type.

**Suggestion: Modularize with Metadata Providers**

*   **Create Metadata "Calculators":** Refactor the metadata calculation logic into separate classes or functions (e.g., `MD5Calculator`, `HistogramCalculator`, `LLMEmbeddingCalculator`).
*   **Define a Common Interface:** Each calculator should have a consistent interface, for example, a `calculate(file_node)` method.
*   **Dynamic Dispatch:** The main processing loop in `flatten_structure` would iterate through the files and, based on the user's selected options, invoke only the required calculators for each file. Each calculator would be responsible for its own caching logic (i.e., checking if the metadata already exists on the `file_node` before performing an expensive calculation).

## 5. Flexible Strategy Pattern

**Observation:**
The system for choosing a comparison strategy is rigid, using a series of `if` statements in `find_common_strategy.py`. This violates the Open/Closed Principle, as adding a new comparison method requires modifying this central file.

**Best Practice Recommendation: Implement the Strategy Pattern**

**Implementation Steps:**

1.  **Define a `BaseComparisonStrategy` Interface:** Create an abstract base class (`abc.ABC`) that defines the "contract" for all comparison strategies (e.g., an `option_key` property and a `compare(file1, file2)` method).
2.  **Implement Concrete Strategies:** Refactor each comparison function (`compare_by_size.py`, etc.) into a class that inherits from the base strategy.
3.  **Use Automatic Discovery:** Create a "strategy registry" that automatically discovers and registers all available strategy classes.
4.  **Simplify the Orchestrator:** The main `run` function would ask the registry for the active strategies based on user options and then execute them, without needing to know the concrete implementations.

## 8. LLM Engine Lifecycle Management

**Observation:**
The LLM engine is loaded on-demand, which introduces a significant delay the first time a user performs an LLM-related action.

**Suggestion: Offer Pre-loading as an Option**

*   **Add a User Setting:** Introduce a setting (e.g., in `settings.json` or a new settings dialog) to "Pre-load LLM engine on startup".
*   **Background Loading:** If this setting is enabled, the application should start loading the LLM engine in a background thread immediately on launch. The status bar can indicate the loading progress, making the engine instantly available when the user needs it.

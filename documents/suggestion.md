## 2. Data Storage: Migrating from JSON to SQLite

**Observation:**
The current project file format (`.cfp`) is a single, large JSON file. While simple to implement, this approach has significant drawbacks for this application's use case, particularly concerning performance, scalability, and data integrity. All operations require loading the entire file into memory, and a crash during a save operation can corrupt the entire project.

**Best Practice Recommendation: Use SQLite**

The industry best practice for a desktop application that needs to store, manage, and query structured data is a file-based SQL database, for which Python has excellent built-in support via the `sqlite3` module.

**Advantages of SQLite:**

*   **Performance & Scalability:** SQLite is designed for efficient querying. Finding duplicate files based on size, date, or MD5 hash can be done with indexed SQL queries, which will be orders of magnitude faster and more memory-efficient than iterating through a massive JSON structure. This is critical for supporting folders with tens or hundreds of thousands of files.
*   **Data Integrity:** SQLite provides atomic, transactional updates. This means that if the application crashes while writing data, the database file is not corrupted and remains in a consistent state, protecting user data.
*   **Efficient Queries:** The core logic of finding duplicates can be dramatically simplified and accelerated. Instead of complex, multi-phase grouping and comparison in Python, the work can be offloaded to the database. For example: `SELECT * FROM files GROUP BY size, md5 HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;`
*   **No New Dependencies:** The `sqlite3` module is part of the Python standard library.

**Implementation Steps:**

1.  **Change Project File Extension:** Project files could be renamed to `.cfpdb` or similar to reflect the new format.
2.  **Define a Schema:** Create a simple database schema on project creation.
    *   `project_settings` table: A key-value table to store folder paths, UI options, etc.
    *   `files` table: A table to store file information with columns like `id`, `folder_index` (1 or 2), `relative_path`, `size`, `modified_date`, `md5`, `histogram`, `llm_embedding`.
3.  **Refactor Logic:**
    *   The `build_folder_structure` logic in `logic.py` would now insert file records into the `files` table.
    *   The metadata calculation in `strategies/utils.py` would become an `UPDATE` operation on existing rows in the `files` table.
    *   The core comparison logic in `find_common_strategy.py` and `find_duplicates_strategy.py` would be replaced with SQL queries.

## 5. Flexible Strategy Pattern

**Observation:**
The current system for comparison strategies relies on orchestrator files (`find_common_strategy.py`) that explicitly import and check for each individual strategy using a series of `if` statements. This pattern is rigid and violates the Open/Closed Principle, as adding a new strategy requires modifying this central file.

**Best Practice Recommendation: Implement the Strategy Pattern**

To make the system more flexible, maintainable, and extensible, a formal Strategy Pattern should be implemented using Python's Abstract Base Classes (ABCs).

**Implementation Steps:**

1.  **Define a `BaseComparisonStrategy` Interface:** Create a new file (`strategies/base.py`) with an abstract class that defines the "contract" all strategies must follow. This ensures consistency and makes the system self-documenting.
    ```python
    # strategies/base.py
    from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

    class BaseComparisonStrategy(ABC):
        @property
        @abstractmethod
        def option_key(self) -> str:
            """The key used in the UI options dict (e.g., 'compare_size')."""
            pass

        @abstractmethod
        def compare(self, file1_info: dict, file2_info: dict) -> bool:
            """The core comparison logic. Returns True if files match."""
            pass
    ```

2.  **Implement Concrete Strategies:** Refactor each comparison function (e.g., `compare_by_size.py`) into a class that inherits from `BaseComparisonStrategy` and implements the required properties and methods.
    ```python
    # strategies/compare_by_size.py
    from .base import BaseComparisonStrategy

    class SizeStrategy(BaseComparisonStrategy):
        @property
        def option_key(self) -> str:
            return "compare_size"

        def compare(self, file1_info: dict, file2_info: dict) -> bool:
            size1 = file1_info.get('compare_size')
            size2 = file2_info.get('compare_size')
            return size1 is not None and size1 == size2
    ```

3.  **Use Automatic Discovery:** Create a "strategy registry" that automatically discovers all available strategy classes. This eliminates the need for manual `import` and `if` statements in the orchestrator.
    ```python
    # strategies/registry.py
    # This can be implemented in a way that it automatically finds all
    # subclasses of BaseComparisonStrategy.

    # A simplified version:
    from . import compare_by_size, compare_by_date # etc.
    ALL_STRATEGIES = [
        compare_by_size.SizeStrategy(),
        compare_by_date.DateStrategy(),
        # To add a new strategy, just add it to this list.
    ]

    def get_active_strategies(opts: dict) -> list:
        return [s for s in ALL_STRATEGIES if opts.get(s.option_key)]
    ```

4.  **Simplify the Orchestrator:** The `find_common_strategy.py` file becomes simpler and no longer needs to be modified when new strategies are added, thus adhering to the Open/Closed Principle.
    ```python
    # find_common_strategy.py
    from .registry import get_active_strategies

    def run(info1, info2, opts):
        # ...
        active_strategies = get_active_strategies(opts)
        # ...
        is_match = all(s.compare(file1_info, file2_info) for s in active_strategies)
        # ...
    ```

## 6. Strategy & Logic Improvements

**Observation:**
The core strategy logic is sound, but some implementations could be clearer and more consistent.

**Suggestions:**

*   **Decouple LLM and Histogram Thresholds:** In `find_common_strategy.py`, the LLM comparison reuses the histogram threshold. This is confusing and semantically incorrect. A dedicated `llm_similarity_threshold` should be added to the UI and the `options` dictionary to separate these concerns.

*   **Clarify the "Search" Mode:** The "Search" mode currently just displays all files that match a given filter. Its purpose is unclear. It should either be:
    1.  **Removed:** If it doesn't provide significant value over the operating system's search functionality.
    2.  **Enhanced:** Given a proper search strategy that could, for example, search by metadata attributes (e.g., "find all files larger than 10MB").

*   **Improve `find_duplicates_strategy.py` Robustness:** When only "Histogram" is selected for finding duplicates, the strategy groups all files into a single bucket, which can be extremely slow. A warning should be displayed to the user in the UI if they select this combination, recommending they also select a keying strategy like "Size" to narrow down the search space.

## 8. UI/UX and Accessibility

**Observation:**
The user experience could be improved with better feedback and more ways to interact with the application.

**Suggestions:**

*   **Add Tooltips:** Add tooltips to buttons and options to explain their purpose, especially for the more complex ones like the histogram comparison methods and their corresponding thresholds.

*   **Implement Keyboard Shortcuts:** Add keyboard shortcuts for frequent actions to improve accessibility and speed for power users. For example:
    *   `Ctrl+B` to trigger the "Build" action for the selected folder.
    *   `Ctrl+R` to "Run" the main "Compare" or "Find Duplicates" action.
    *   Arrow keys to navigate the results list.

*   **Ensure Logical Tab Order:** Review and enforce a logical tab order for all interactive elements in the main window, allowing users to navigate the entire application using only the keyboard.

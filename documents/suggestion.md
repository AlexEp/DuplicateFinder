# Code Review Suggestions

This document provides a deep-dive analysis of the codebase and offers suggestions for improvement across several areas, including architecture, code organization, performance, and user experience.

## 5. Flexible Strategy Pattern

**Observation:**
The system for choosing a comparison strategy is rigid, using a series of `if` statements in `find_common_strategy.py`. This violates the Open/Closed Principle, as adding a new comparison method requires modifying this central file.

**Best Practice Recommendation: Implement the Strategy Pattern**

**Implementation Steps:**

1.  **Define a `BaseComparisonStrategy` Interface:** Create an abstract base class (`abc.ABC`) that defines the "contract" for all comparison strategies (e.g., an `option_key` property and a `compare(file1, file2)` method).
2.  **Implement Concrete Strategies:** Refactor each comparison function (`compare_by_size.py`, etc.) into a class that inherits from the base strategy.
3.  **Use Automatic Discovery:** Create a "strategy registry" that automatically discovers and registers all available strategy classes.
4.  **Simplify the Orchestrator:** The main `run` function would ask the registry for the active strategies based on user options and then execute them, without needing to know the concrete implementations.

## 8. LLM Engine Lifecycle Management

**Observation:**
The LLM engine is loaded on-demand, which introduces a significant delay the first time a user performs an LLM-related action.

**Suggestion: Offer Pre-loading as an Option**

*   **Add a User Setting:** Introduce a setting (e.g., in `settings.json` or a new settings dialog) to "Pre-load LLM engine on startup".
*   **Background Loading:** If this setting is enabled, the application should start loading the LLM engine in a background thread immediately on launch. The status bar can indicate the loading progress, making the engine instantly available when the user needs it.
